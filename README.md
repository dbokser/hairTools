A set of tools to help in creating and shaping hair curves in Maya

Usage:
1. Download the hairTools zip.

2. Extract the contents to /Applications/Autodesk/maya2015/plug-ins.
(Note: I'm showing the path of the plug-ins folder for a Mac OS X computer.  You may need to locate and change the folder path if on Windows.)

3.  Check inside your /Applications/Autodesk/maya2015/plug-ins folder.  Make sure you have a folder called hairTools inside your plug-ins folder.

4. In Maya, open a Python console and enter this code:
import sys
sys.path.append( '/Applications/Autodesk/maya2015/plug-ins')

5. Execute the code you just typed in

6. Now type this in the Python console:
import hairTools.hairTools as hairTools
hairTools.hairballUI()

7.  Execute the code you just typed in. You can now start using this nice tool.
